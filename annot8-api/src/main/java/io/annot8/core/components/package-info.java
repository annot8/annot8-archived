/**
 * This package contains the core interface for components.
 *
 * <p>There are three main types of components in Annot8:
 *
 * <p>1) Source - these produce new items for processing 2) Processor - these process items, for
 * example by adding annotations 3) Resource - these are reusable classes that can be used by other
 * components
 *
 * <p>Components are required to declare their capabilities with a Capabilities object, which may be
 * configuration dependent.
